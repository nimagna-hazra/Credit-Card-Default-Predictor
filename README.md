# Credit-Card-Default-Predictor
Logistic Regression Model to classify credit card defaulters 

Development of a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn's LogisticRegression() that classifies credit card defaulters.

The features used for training the model include 
1. Financial records: Historic data of timely payments, credit line, bill amount
2. Demographic data like sex, education, age, marital status

Variables are treated using proper standardisation and encoding techniques.

The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision and recall rates and ROC curve is also constructed.

Finally, hyperparameter tuning is deployed to improve model performance.

This is a generalistic approach to classification using Logistic Regression and can be extended to other feature sets and use cases.
